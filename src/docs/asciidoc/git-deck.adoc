Teaching principles - not tools
For demos I will solely use the command line. If that's not what you're used to don't fret it's not important to remember what I am typing, it's important to remember the concepts I'm explaining.
There will be some parts where you see me poking around with Git internals.

Not a talk about best practices or how you to use git.

Sound Familiar?

=== What you're (hopefully) going to learn

* Basic git data structures
* What a commit is
* What a branch is
* What a merge is
* What happens when you push and pull
* What hashes represent

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Remembering a list of git commands is not good enough

If you don't understand the git principles the git documentation is useless

Help to describe the basic principles of git so that you can apply these in the real world.
So that next time you have a problem in git you should be able to understand what went wrong, you should start to understand what certain commands do.
--

== Fundementals

* DVCS
* Hashes
* .git directory

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Before I move on it's important to understand these 2 things.

Git is a DVCS this means that you store the entire repository locally. The git central server is there purely to aid sharing code.

Git uses SHA-1 hashes to represent just about everything. Generally displayed as hex encoded.
`git hash-object somefile`
Git uses short hashes to make things a bit simpler.
`git log --oneline` will show history with short hash. `git log` will show history with full hash.
Git will give you enough bits of the hash to identifiy a unique file.

I will come on to what hashes represent later.
Important to get your head around how the hashses work. This is a real lightbulb moment and other understanding stems from there.

As I'm sure many of you have noticed there is a .git directory at the root of each git project.
The entire repo is stored inside here.
I will delve into this directory a bit, but don't try to manually manipulate it's contents unless you REALLY know what you're doing.
--

== Git Data Model

This is the structure that git uses to store commits.

[.stretch]
image::object-tree.png[]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Here we see the fundemental building blocks of everything stored in git.

One way direction Commits Point to trees, trees point to others trees and blobs, blobs don't point anywhere.
You can't work you're way back up without lots of searching.

All parts are stored in the same way. So way to differentiate between the different types

Everything is identified by a unique hash

All parts are stored in .git/objects

SideNote: if you run `git gc` or `git pack` then they may be stored slightly differently on disk to save space but the underlying principles are the same.

Git is one big interlocked tree. You will hopefully start to see this as we go along.
--

=== Commits

Represents a commit - Contain some meta data:

* *tree*: pointer to a tree
* *author*: author details
* *committer*: similar to author (rarely different unless you want them to be)
* *parent*: pointer to a previous commit (initial commit is empty)
* *commit message*: Text that should describe the commit
* occasionally some other meta data

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Tree - just a hash that points to another commit

Author - The person who wrote the code

Committer - the person who commited the code. These are usually the same person. If you are applying someone else's patch.
Most git tools don't differentiate between commiter and author.

Autor and committer also include an Epoch timestamp and timezone

Parent - parent commit. It is possible to have multiple parents - e.g. Merges.
The first commit doesn't have a parent

Lets have a look at a commit.

`git init`

`touch empty.txt`

`git add empty.txt`

`git commit -m 'initial commit - only an empty file'`

Now we have a git in our git repo lets go find it. There is a useful tool to poking around with these internals that is included in git by default `git cat-file`.

Before we can do that we need the hash `git rev-parse HEAD` will give us that

`git cat-file commit <hash>`

If we add another empty file and another commit

`touch empty2.txt`

`git add empty2.txt`

`git commit -m 'second commit - another empty file'`

and then look at the second commit we can see a parent
--

=== Trees

Represent directories

A tree must point at least 1 other tree or a blob

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Contains a the entire file tree

each tree repesents a directory and contains a list of blobs (files) and trees (directories) both identified by their hash

any change to the contents of a directory changes it's hash

Lets have a look at a real repo - using the one we already created

`git cat-file commit <hash>`

Gives is the hash of the tree

`git ls-tree <hash>`

We can see here our 2 files in the git repo - and their file permissions (it is possible to turn off file permissions)
You'll notice that the 2 files have the exact same hash - this is becuase the files contain byte for byte the same file.

`ls-tree` gives us the root tree node. here we only have 2 files and no directories. Lets add a new directory with a file.

`mkdir dir1`

`touch dir1/empty3.txt`

`git add dir1/empty3.txt`

`git commit -m 'third commit - a third empty file'`

get our new tree hash

`git cat-file commit $(git rev-parse HEAD)`

Now we can see our new directory which is of type tree. For completeness we can have a look inside this directory and see the other file we created.

`git ls-tree <HASH>`
--


=== Blobs

* Represent Files
* Tracking starts once you run `git add`

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Lets look at one of our files. Firstly lets get the hash of the files

`git ls-tree <TREE-HASH>`

Now we can re-use cat-file to view the contents

`git cat-file blob <BLOB-HASH>`

As expected the file is empty.

Lets add some content to a file

`echo 'some file content' > notEmpty.txt`

Lets watch git and see how it changes as we add this file and commit it.

Firstly lets look to see that the file isn't already tracked by git. We can calculate the hash of the file and see that it's not alredy in git.

`git hash-object notEmpty.txt`

`ls .git/objects/`

Now we can add it to git and see what happens

`git add notEmpty.txt`

`ls .git/objects/c2/e7a8d366fd124ec77d39d3ae8a4904d8c1ad3d`

We can see that git has started tracking the file

At this point it's not in a tree though. It will be referenced in the .git/index.

This object has been compressed using zlib so we can't just look directly at the object

Lets commit this new file and see that it's made it into the tree and a new commit is created.

`git commit -m 'our first non-empty file'`

`git rev-parse HEAD` - to get the latest commit

`git cat-file commit <HASH>`

`git ls-tree <HASH>`

More on what happens when we commit a little later on

Questions?
--

=== What does this all mean for git
* Every time you make a change to a file then a while new copy of the file is stored in git.
** This is why git isn't very good at storing large files. Changing 1 byte results in a duplicate file
* Each commit can directly access it's the exact state without having to play
* If you commit the same file it will only be stored once
* There is nothing special about moving or renaming files

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Much of this is actually pretty transparent when you're using due to gits good merge tooling.

Questions?
--

== Branches and Tags
* Branches are Tags are both `refs`.
* They are pointers to a commit
* By convention tags don't change, branches do

[NOTE.speaker]
--
We can see call branches in
`ls .gitrefs/heads`

We can view all tags in
`ls .git/refs/tags`

Refs as a simple as you can get. They are just a text file with the commit hash in.

`cat 'cat .git/refs/master'` matches `git rev-parse HEAD`

At this point we can start to see that everything in git is stored in this connected data structure. Lots of reuse.

Questions?

== Merging

2 Options for merging:

* Fast-forward merge
* Merge Commit

[NOTE.speaker]
--
By default when you merge the first thing git does is figure out if you can do a fast-forward merge.
--

=== Fast-forwarding

* TODO insert diagram

[NOTE.speaker]
--
A fast-forward merge is when the 2 branches have a shared history and the new commits can be added straight to the branch.

Nothing is actually moved the branch is just changed to point at the new HEAD commit.

[INSERT DISGRAM] - on new slide

You can force the type of merge using `--no-ff` when merging or globally using `git config --global merge.ff false`.

This is sometimes desirable if you want to keep a strict history of when things were branched and merged
--

=== Merge commits
Merge commits are commits with 2 or more parents

There are a lots or Merge Strategies and each has lots of options

* Resolve
* Recursive (default)
* Octopus (default if you merge more than 2 branches)
* Ours
* Subtree

See https://git-scm.com/docs/merge-strategies for more info

[NOTE.speaker]
--
If a branch cannot be fast-forwarded then a Merge commit will be created.

*Resolve* This can only resolve two heads (i.e. the current branch and another branch you pulled from) using a 3-way merge algorithm. It tries to carefully detect criss-cross merge ambiguities and is considered generally safe and fast.





--

=== MERGE CONFLICT
image::ahh.gif[background, size=cover]

=== Merge Conflict

* Occurs when the merge strategy can't figure out what the new file will look like.

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Lets have a look at what is going on when we get a conflict.

Create a branch and make a change

`git checkout -b branchb`

`vim notEmpty.txt`

`git commit -am 'change contents of notEmpty'`

Switch back to master and create a conflicting change

`git checkout master`

`vim notEmpty.txt`

`git commit -am 'make a colliding change to notEmpty'`

Now when we merge we get into a merge conflict state

`git merge branchb`

`git status`

lets us know we're in a conflict state. We can also look at the contents of `.git/`
we can see some new files. There are 2 files that point to the original branch and the branch we tried to merge in and a file called MERGE_MODE that lets us know we are mid merge.

Lets quickly fix this and commit

`vim notEmpty.txt`

`git add notEmpty.txt`

When we commit we can see that git has generated us a message explaining the merge.

`git commit`

We can also go back an look at this merge commit and see it's 2 parent commits.

`git cat-file commit $(git rev-parse HEAD)`
--

=== Viewing Branches

* `git log`
* `git tree`?

[NOTE.speaker]
--
I know I said this isn't a talk on best practices and how to use git but here is the exception because `cat-file` is of course a crazy way to look at history and I don't want to see people manually crawling through commits. Here are some better tools.

git log presents a linear history of commits. Add `--oneline` to see a simpler view of history

I'm sure whatever tool you decide to use for git also displays this information in some form or other.
